Loading a web page involves several steps, each critical to ensuring the page is rendered correctly and efficiently in a user's browser. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the process:

1. DNS Resolution  
When a user enters a URL in the browser, the browser first checks its cache to see if it has recently resolved the domain name to an IP address. If not, it queries a DNS server to obtain the IP address associated with the domain name.

2. TCP Connection  
With the IP address in hand, the browser establishes a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection to the server. This typically involves a three-way handshake process:
 - SYN: The browser sends a synchronize (SYN) packet to the server.
 - SYN-ACK: The server responds with a synchronize-acknowledgment (SYN-ACK) packet.
 - ACK: The browser sends an acknowledgment (ACK) packet back to the server, establishing a connection.

3. HTTP Request  
Once the TCP connection is established, the browser sends an HTTP (or HTTPS) request to the server. This request includes the method (e.g., GET, POST), the URL, and other headers (such as user-agent and cookies).

4. Server Processing  
The server receives the HTTP request, processes it, and prepares a response. This may involve querying databases, performing computations, and generating dynamic content.

5. HTTP Response  
The server sends an HTTP response back to the browser. This response includes status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found), headers (e.g., content-type, content-length), and the body of the response, which typically contains the HTML content of the web page.

6. HTML Parsing and DOM Construction  
The browser receives the HTML content and begins parsing it. As it parses the HTML, it constructs the Document Object Model (DOM), a tree-like representation of the structure of the web page.

7. Resource Requests  
While parsing the HTML, the browser encounters references to other resources (e.g., CSS files, JavaScript files, images). It makes additional HTTP requests to fetch these resources.
CSS files are downloaded and applied to the DOM, constructing the CSSOM (CSS Object Model).
JavaScript files are downloaded and executed, potentially modifying the DOM and CSSOM.

8. Rendering and Layout  
With the DOM and CSSOM constructed, the browser combines them to create the Render Tree, which represents the visual elements on the page.
The browser then performs the layout process, calculating the exact position and size of each element on the screen.

9. Painting
The browser paints the content to the screen, converting the Render Tree into pixels on the user's display.

10. JavaScript Execution
If there are JavaScript files, they continue to execute, which may result in further changes to the DOM, triggering reflows (layout recalculations) and repaints as necessary.

11. User Interaction  
The page is fully loaded, but the browser remains responsive to user interactions (e.g., clicks, typing), handling events and potentially making additional requests (e.g., AJAX calls) to update the page dynamically.


### Example Walkthrough:
1. User enters www.example.com in the browser.
2. DNS resolution: The browser resolves www.example.com to an IP address, say 93.184.216.34.
3. TCP connection: The browser establishes a TCP connection with 93.184.216.34.
4. HTTP request: The browser sends an HTTP GET request to http://93.184.216.34.
5. Server processing: The server processes the request and generates a response.
6. HTTP response: The server sends back an HTML document.
7. HTML parsing: The browser starts parsing the HTML and constructing the DOM.
8. Resource requests: The browser requests linked CSS, JavaScript, and images.
9. Rendering and layout: The browser constructs the Render Tree and performs layout.
10. Painting: The browser paints the elements to the screen.
11. JavaScript execution: JavaScript files are executed, modifying the DOM if necessary.
12. User interaction: The page is interactive, and the browser responds to user inputs.
