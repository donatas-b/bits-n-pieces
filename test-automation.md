### Decide What Test Cases to Automate
It is impractical to automate all testing, so it is important to determine what test cases should be automated first. 

The benefit of automated testing is linked to how many times a given test can be repeated. Tests that are only performed a few times are better left for manual testing. Good test cases for automation are ones that are run frequently and require large amounts of data to perform the same action.

You can get the most benefit out of your automated testing efforts by automating:
 - Repetitive tests that run for multiple builds.
 - Tests that tend to cause human error.
 - Tests that require multiple data sets.
 - Frequently used functionality that introduces high risk conditions.
 - Tests that are impossible to perform manually.
 - Tests that run on several different hardware or software platforms and configurations.
 - Tests that take a lot of effort and time when manual testing.
