What Is Cross Browser Testing?

Cross Browser Testing is a testing method for validating that the application under test works as expected on different browsers, at varying viewport sizes, and devices. It can be done manually or as part of a test automation strategy. The tooling required for this activity can be built in-house or provided by external vendors.

Cross browser testing refers to the practice of verifying that web applications work as expected across many different combinations of web browsers, operating systems, and devices. Though all web browsers support the common web standards (including HTML and CSS), browsers can still render code in different ways. These disparities in appearance and function can arise from various factors, such as:

1. Differences in the default settings on a browser or operating system (for example, the default font used by a browser).
2. Differences in user-defined settings, such as screen resolution.
3. Disparities in hardware functionality, which can lead to differences in screen resolution or color balancing.
4. Differences in the engines used to process web instructions.
5. Variations among clients in the version support for recent web standards, such as CSS3.
6. The use of assistive technologies, such as screen readers.
